# 🌾 Agricultural Crop Yield in Indian States – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project dives into the agricultural landscape of India through detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a crop yield dataset spanning various states, seasons, and years. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that can inform policy, support farmers, and contribute to sustainable agriculture.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** Indian agricultural crop yield dataset with details on crop, state, year, season, area, production, rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide usage.
- **Objective:** Explore the relationship between different agronomic and environmental factors and their impact on crop yield across India.
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code execution and presentation

---

## 🔍 EDA Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers using IQR
2. **Categorical Analysis:** Seasonal and crop-wise distributions
3. **Correlation Analysis:** Between rainfall, area, pesticide, and yield
4. **Trend Analysis:** Year-wise and region-wise production
5. **Visual Insights:** Created over 20+ charts for clarity and pattern recognition

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Most Common Crop:** Wheat
- **Top Production Year:** 2013
- **Most Common Season:** Kharif
- **Positive correlation** between rainfall and crop production
- **Sugarcane** showed strong and consistent yield patterns
- **Urea** is the most commonly used pesticide

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Missing or inconsistent entries in some years/states
- Fertilizer and pesticide data lacks type-level granularity
- Dataset may not reflect technological or regional policy changes
- Aggregated data may hide local variations

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Promote **climate-resilient farming practices**
- Invest in **weather-based early warning systems**
- Use **precision agriculture** for optimal resource use
- Focus on **regional crop optimization strategies**
